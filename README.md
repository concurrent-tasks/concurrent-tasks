# üëãüèº Introduction

Concurrent Tasks mimics a queue by using JavaScript's inbuilt array data type. Each task is a function which signals completion back to the runner.

The minimalism of Concurrent Tasks makes it an easy-to-use solution across any framework or flavour of JavaScript. It has **ZERO dependencies** and can be used virtually in any scenario. With a **minified and gzipped size of 2.7kB**, it is the ultimate lightweight tool for your concurrency needs.

### Browser

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/concurrent-tasks/umd/concurrent-tasks.min.js"
  type="text/javascript"
></script>
```

### Bun

```bash
bun install concurrent-tasks
```

### Deno

```ts
import { TaskRunner } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/concurrent-tasks/src/index.ts";
```

### Usage

> **Important:** Each task passed to the task runner, necessarily has to call the done function. If not, your queue won't process properly.

```typescript
import TaskRunner from "concurrent-tasks";

const runner = new TaskRunner();

function generateTasks() {
  const tasks = [];
  let count = 1000;
  while (count) {
    tasks.push((done) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        done();
      }, Math.random() * 1000);
    });
    count--;
  }
  return tasks;
}

runner.addMultiple(generateTasks());

runner.start();
```
