## Why another task runner?

While writing page fragments or a priority queue in JavaScript, we often come across some hurdles. It's either no real inbuilt option, or a lot of code to perform a simple task. Concurrent Tasks aims to solve this by providing a simple FIFO queue. The queue not only maintains the order, but also enables you to manipulate it and suit it according to your liking. 

## What can I use it with?

The simplicity of Concurrent Tasks makes it an easy-to-use solution across any framework or flavour of JavaScript. It has **ZERO** dependencies and can be used virtually in any scenario.

* Vanilla JavaScript
* Frontend Frameworks \(React, Vue, Angular, etc\)
* Backend Frameworks \(Express, Hapi, Koa, etc\)
* NPM Module
* Node CLI Application
