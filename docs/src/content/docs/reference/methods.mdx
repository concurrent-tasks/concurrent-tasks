import References from "../../../components/References.astro";

##### start

```ts
start(): boolean
```

- Start the runner and begin execution of tasks
- Returns `false` if the runner is busy or destroyed
- The [`start`](#start) method can be used to unpause the runner

---

##### pause

```ts
pause(): boolean
```

:::note

The `pause` event is fired once all the running tasks are done, to ensure the duration and task list reported are correct.

:::

- Pauses the runner instance
- Running tasks are unaffected
- Once all running tasks are done, the runner will be marked as idle
- Returns `false` if the runner is destroyed
- The [`start`](#start) method can be used to unpause the runner

---

##### destroy

```ts
destroy(): void
```

:::caution

- Destroyed instances cannot be started
- Any add operations on tasks will fail silently

:::

:::note

The `destroy` event is fired once all the running tasks are done, to ensure the duration and task list reported are correct.

:::

- Destroys the runner instance
- Running tasks are unaffected
- Once all running tasks are done, the runner will be marked as idle

---

##### setConcurrency

```ts
setConcurrency(concurrency: number): void
```

- Sets the concurrency of the runner
- Concurrency should be a positive integer, or `-1`
- Setting concurrency as `-1` would run all tasks at once
- If concurrency is not bound, throws a `RangeError`

---

##### add

```ts
add(task: TaskWithDone<T>, prepend?: boolean): void
```

<References>[`TaskWithDone`][TaskWithDone]</References>

- Add a task to end of the pending list
- Passing `true` as the second argument will add the task to the beginning of the pending list

---

##### addFirst

```ts
addFirst(task: TaskWithDone<T>): void
```

<References>[`TaskWithDone`][TaskWithDone]</References>

- Add a task to the beginning of the pending list
- Alias for `add` with the second argument as `true`

---

##### addAt

```ts
addAt(index: number, task: TaskWithDone<T>): void
```

<References>[`TaskWithDone`][TaskWithDone]</References>

- Add a task at a particular index to the pending list
- Index should always be bound, otherwise throws a `RangeError`

---

##### addMultiple

```ts
addMultiple(tasks: TasksWithDone<T>, prepend?: boolean): void
```

<References>[`TasksWithDone`][TasksWithDone]</References>

- Add multiple tasks to end of the pending list
- Passing `true` as the second argument will add the tasks to the beginning of the pending list

---

##### addMultipleFirst

```ts
addMultipleFirst(tasks: TasksWithDone<T>): void
```

<References>[`TasksWithDone`][TasksWithDone]</References>

- Add multiple tasks to the beginning of the pending list
- Alias for `addMultiple` with the second argument as `true`

---

##### remove

```ts
remove(first?: boolean): void
```

- Remove the task at the end of the pending list
- Passing `true` as the first argument will remove the task at the beginning of the pending list

---

##### removeFirst

```ts
removeFirst(): void
```

- Remove the task at the beginning of the pending list
- Alias for `remove` with the first argument as `true`

---

##### removeAt

```ts
removeAt(index: number): void
```

- Remove a task at a particular index
- Index should always be bound, otherwise throws a `RangeError`

---

##### removeRange

```ts
removeRange(start: number, count: number): void
```

- Remove tasks at a particular range from the pending list
- The count is inclusive of the starting index
- Starting index should always be bound, otherwise throws a `RangeError`

---

##### removeAll

```ts
removeAll(): void
```

- Remove all tasks from the pending list
