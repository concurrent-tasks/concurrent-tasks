What is the `done` callback and why is it important?

## Problem

Concurrent Tasks is a JavaScript module, which runs multiple tasks concurrently until all the tasks are complete. It needs a way to figure out when a particular task has been completed.

## Solution

Gulp solves this problem by either accepting a return of a Gulp task, or by calling a function done. Similarly, to solve the exact same problem, each task passed to the TaskRunner has access to a special function called `done` (ingenuity max).

## Purpose

The purpose of this function is simple: Tell the instance when a particular task is complete!

Internally, the done function does a fair amount of work:

- Makes a free slot available for the internal runner
- Updates completion counts and calls the internal runner
- Updates the time elapsed from start, until the function calling done's completion
- Calls the internal runner to pick up the next task in the queue

## Examples

It's a very simplistic approach, which can be used across anything. Be it functions, Promises, timeouts etc.

### Functions

```ts
import { TaskRunner } from "concurrent-tasks";

const runner = new TaskRunner();

function randomNumbers(done) {
  const numbers = [];
  let count = 1000;
  while (count) {
    numbers.push(Math.round(Math.random() * 100));
    count--;
  }
  done();
}

runner.add(randomNumbers);
```

### Promises

```ts
import { TaskRunner } from "concurrent-tasks";

const runner = new TaskRunner();

function getGoogle(done) {
  fetch("http://www.google.com")
    .then((data) => {
      console.log("data", data);
      done();
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.log("error", error);
      done();
      runner.add(getGoogle); // retry fetching data
    });
}

runner.add(getGoogle);
```

### Timeouts

```ts
import { TaskRunner } from "concurrent-tasks";

const runner = new TaskRunner();

function afterTimeout(done) {
  const timeout = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(`This resolved after ${timeout}ms`);
    done();
  }, timeout);
}

runner.add(afterTimeout);
```
